# Nintendo Switch Online Virtual Console database library

This library provides a way to parse, manipulate and modify the Virtual Console ROM databases for the
Nintendo Switch Online Virtual Console apps, currently supporting the GBA and the SNES/SFC.

This repository also provides a parser for SNES SFROM files, which are used to store ROM data for the SNES/SFC games.

The SNES app requires a mod to be installed to circumvent the DRM checks if you want to add a new game instead of replacing an existing one.
This will not be supported by this library.

It is an early work in progress, and is not yet ready to be exported into a usable format.
If you'd like a quick, user-friendly way to interact with the database, please check out the
[CaVE Database Manager](http://darkakuma.z-net.us/p/cave-database-manager-v15.html) tool for now.
